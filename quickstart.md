# Greenlight Quickstart

Read the **Introduction** card aloud.

This a game about telling stories similar to those your group may see on television. You will create the story for an entire television season in a single session. Here's how to everyone is expected to behave during the game.

* Treat other players as human beings.
* Think about the fiction earnestly.
* Interrogate the fiction by asking questions.
* Respect  the fiction by playing to get answers.

## Setup

As a group, lay out the **Character**, **Location**, **Action**, **Plan**, **Scenario** and **Position** cards on the table so all the players can easily access them. Make a home for each type so players know where to return them to.

> For a standard length game use three **Position** cards per player. Split them up between the two types. Use two per player for a  shorter game. Use four per player for a longer game.

While Laying out the cards, discuss these questions.

* What network or type of network is this show on?
* What is the show's rating? Any viewer discretion advisories?
* Is the opening, 90 seconds of character montages with a theme-song? 5 seconds of a splash screen with the show's title? Or, Something else entirely?
* What genre is the show? Which shows have similar vibes?

## Playing the game

Have each player choose a **Character**. While others are choosing, everyone should think about how their **Character** might respond to these questions.

* Which other **Characters** or **Locations** are you familiar with? Which is most important?
* What is your *big goal* for the season?

Choose a player, hand that player the **Backstory** card. Continue until each player has had a turn.

Have each player choose a **Scenario** which represents the final scene of their *big goal*. 

>Remember to think big! If all your **Character's** dreams come true this season, what happens?

Each player should place their **Scenario** to their right. This combined with their **Character** is now their **Storyline**. 

>New **Scenarios** will be gained throughout the game and, may be placed anywhere inside the existing **Storyline**. However, the relative order of older cards may not me changed. Cards to the left happen earlier in the season than cards on the right.

Choose a player, hand that player the **Spotlight**. Continue playing until there are no more **Position** cards.

## Ending the game

When all the **Positions** are gone, the game is over. 

Hold an election for both **Position** types, each player gets one vote for each **Position** of that type they have. The winner of the controlled vote will get what they want, more or less. The winner of the desperate vote will also get what they want, with a great cost that perhaps makes them wish they hadn't.

The selected players should work together with the rest of the group to resolve their stories in a appropriately awesome way. Use the final **Scenario** selected at the beginning of the game as guidance. Make the ending big enough that your show will get picked up next season.
