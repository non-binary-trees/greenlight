Greenlight is a roleplaying game in which you will direct, produce, write and star in your own television series. Each player will create a character that is the star of their own story-line. Together, you will explore the story of an entire television season in a single session.

# Rules

## The Basics

### What you'll Need

* A bunch of note cards. (just bring a whole pack) 
* Some other human beings. A few or more but, less than lots. (3-5 for people who like numbers)
* Writing utensils. Enough to share.
* A handful of entropy. (coins or dice work)

### How to Behave

Be curious and respectful.

* Think about the fiction earnestly.
* Interrogate the fiction by asking questions.
* Treat other players as human beings.

### Engagement Roll

When asked to make an engagement roll, the player rolls the number of dice indicated and chooses any die as the result. If the result is even, your position is *Risky*. If the result is odd, your position is *Desperate*.

> No dice? coins work too! Heads, your position is *Risky*. Tails, your position is *Desperate*.

> Why would you ever choose a *Desperate* position? See [The Wrap](#the-wrap)

### Starting the Game

If this is anyone's first time playing, read this aloud.

> We all know that every story has a beginning and an end. In this game, each character solidifies both these points when they start a season. We play the game to find out what happens in between.
>
> As we craft each scene, it is connected to an ever growing chain of scenes rooted in either the beginning or the end of a character's story. The stuff in between remains unknown.
>
> We explore the unknown by probing it's edges. The points closest to what we already know. These points are known as [The Before](#when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything) and [The After](#when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything) because they are the points immediately before or after the unknown part of our story.

If this is your first session or, you are beginning a new series, follow the steps in [The Season](#the-season).

## The Season

1. Create [The Pitch](#the-pitch).
2. Repeat [The Shoot](#the-shoot) until everyone has had a chance to try out all the roles a couple times.
3. Do [The Break](#the-break).
4. Do [The Twist](#the-twist).
5. Repeat [The Shoot](#the-shoot) until everyone has had a chance to try out all the roles a couple times.
6. Do [The Wrap](#the-wrap).

## The Pitch

> WIP Note: There probably needs to be some preliminary discussion here to get people on the same page. Talk about expectations of tone and have a brief discussion about what media you find interesting and why. This is primarily a game about television but draw from any media --- movies, comics, books, music, paintings are all fair game.

Grab a new card as *The Pitch*.

1. Together, create a single line pitching the show. Record on *The Pitch*.
2. Together, [create a pallet](#creating-a-pallet).
3. Together, [create a trailer](#creating-a-trailer). 
4. Each player, [create a focus](#creating-a-focus). 
5. Together, title the first and last episodes of the season. Record on *The Pitch*.
6. Each player, [create a character](#creating-a-character).
7. Each player, [create a snag](#creating-a-snag) for each focus.
8. Together, title the show. Record on *The Pitch*.
9. Everyone, do [The Break](#the-break).

See [example](#example-pitch)

### Creating a Pallet

Grab a new card as *Actions*. Label it.

Grab a new card as *Plans*. Label it.

If your group is new to the game or, looking for a set experience, use the actions and plans found [here](#lists). Record on *Actions* and *Plans* respectively.

Otherwise, make your group's own with the following rules

#### Actions

These are the verbs of your story. Think about a problem a character might have and ask that character, "What do you do, *right now*?" 

Create three to twelve actions. Record on *Actions*.

See [example](#example-actions)

#### Plans

These are the events of your story. Think about a problem a character might have and ask that character, "What *will* you do?" 

For each plan, leave a blank spot that needs to be filled in later. This is the *Detail*.

Create two to six plans. Record on *Plans*.

See [example](#example-plans)

### Creating a Trailer

Create the trailer. Imagine you must create a 15 second trailer for the show.

Take turns, writing down things that are in the trailer or things that got cut from the trailer. Create two categories, keep and cut. Record on *The Pitch*.

Things you keep are what you definitely want to be a part of your game. Things you cut from the trailer are things you definitely don't want in the game. 

When it is your turn to write one of these down, you have the final say, Say yes to ideas you are exited to explore. Say no to ideas that are over used or obnoxious.

After the first round, go around again. If everyone had something to add, keep going around. 

See [example](#example-pitch)

### Creating a Focus

Grab a blank card. 

Write down a topic that you want everyone to explore, keep it to a few words or less. Place it near the middle of the table.

See [example](#example-focus)

### Creating a Character

Grab a blank card as your *Character*.

Grab a blank card as your *Agenda*.

1. Come up with a name. Record on your *Character*
2. Make up a short description. Record on your *Character*
3. In one line, write what your character wants to accomplish this season. Record on your *Agenda*
4. Place your *Character* on your left. This is the begging of your pile know as [The Before](#when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything).
5. Place your *Agenda* sideways on your right. This is the begging of your pile known as [The After](#when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything).
 6. Choose one:
     * [Create an extra](#creating-an-extra) that you have or want to have a relationship with.
     * [Create a location](#creating-a-location) that you have or want to go to.

See [example](#example-character)

### Creating an Extra

Grab an index card write down a name and a quick description. Set that card down in the middle for everyone to see. Something like *Doris, The elderly bank-teller* works fine.

See [example](#example-cast)

### Creating a Location

Grab an index card write down a name and a quick description. Set that card down in the middle for everyone to see. Something like *Poorly-managed Convenience Store* works fine.

See [example](#example-location)

### Creating a Snag

Grab a blank card.

Write down a complication which may arise when exploring a specific focus, keep it to a few words or less. Place it next to that focus.

See [example](#example-snag)

## The Shoot

This is the part of the game you will spend the most time in. It is meant to flow as a conversation would. Authority switches among the roles but, stay engaged when it isn't your turn. Remember what is expected of your [behavior](#how-to-behave).



1. *(director)* **Previously...** — If [The Before](#when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything) has not been recapped, give a short description of what happened.
2. *(producer)* **The Focus** — Choose a focus as *The Focus*.
3. *(writer)* **The Snag** — Choose a snag card from *The Focus* as *The Snag* must be different than *The Before* and *The After*. Give *The Snag* to *The Director*.
4. *(director)* **The Scene** — Place *The Snag* on [The Before](#when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything) or next to [The After](#when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything). The card on top of the selected pile is now *The Scene*. Describe how the obstacle presents itself in *The Scene*.
5. *(director)* **The Action / The Plan** — Choose one:
	* After *The Plan* and *The Detail* are chosen, choose an action as *The Action*. Record on *The Scene*.
	* Choose a plan as *The Plan*. The *writer* will always choose the *Detail*. Record on *The Scene*.
6. *(producer)* **The Plan / The Action** — The producer then performs the option not chosen in step 5
7. *(writer)* **The Detail** — choose the *Detail* for *The Plan*. Record on *The Scene*.
8. *(director)* **The Position** — Make an [Engagement Roll](#engagement-roll) (1). If *The Action* is one of your hype actions, You may establish how the action helps or hinders your chances to instead make an [Engagement Roll](#engagement-roll) (2).
9. *(director)* **The Scene** — Play out [The Scene](#the-scene). See [example](#example-scene)
	1. If your position is *Risky*, what are you about to lose? If your position is *Desperate*, what did you already lose? Record on *The Scene*.
	2. [Choose a location](#choosing-a-location). Record on *The Scene*.
	3. Describe what the camera sees in the moments before the scene unfolds.
	4. [Choose extras](#choosing-extra). Record on *The Scene*. Assign each role to a Player. Players may have more than one 	role. Players always play their own character.
	5. Find out what happens. If your position is *Desperate*, turn *The Scene* [sideways](#when-things-go-sideways).
10. *(director)* **Next Time...** — If *The Snag* was placed next to [The After](#when-that-thing-happens-that-changes-everything), place it on top and give a quick preview of what might happen.
11. *(all)* **pass** — Everyone with a role card passes it one player to the right. 

### Choosing Extras

If you need a character that doesn't already belong to player, you have two options. Take one or [make one](#creating-an-extra).

See [example](#example-cast)

### Choosing a Location

If you need a location, you have two options. Take one or [make one](#creating-a-location).

See [example](#example-location)

## The Break

1. Everyone, [take five](#when-you-take-five). When you get back, change seats.
2. Together, [create a crew](#creating-a-crew) if you haven't; otherwise, shuffle the roles.
3. Each player, [choose a hype](#choosing-a-hype) for the player on your right.

### Choosing a Hype

Tell the player which action you are most interested in seeing their character use. That player records the action on their *Character* as a *Hype*.

See [example](#example-character)

### Creating a Crew

Create crew cards for the following roles: Producer, Director, Writer. Just write the roles on some blank cards. Grab extra blank cards for each player above three. Shuffle all the cards and deal them out. 
	
## The Twist
>  WIP Note: skip this whole section for now. 

For each sideways scene a player has, they may do one of the following:
* add a detail to a location
* add a detail to a character
* remove an action
* change the detail of a plan

> goals
> * try to figure out what is happening in the gap?
> * give a player authority based on the current score?
> * provide some narrative plot twist?
> * edit the play options?

## The Wrap

> WIP Note: This is all weird in play so ignore the other rules, just give everyone an opportunity to say something about a scene that happens to their character to tie things together. This could be a flashback before the season, an addition scene in the unknown part or the current season or scene that happens between this season and next.

Count the number of sideways scenes you have, this is your score.

If you have higher score than any other player, 

>*You have lost almost everything and, you are stronger because of it. Everyone despises or pities you but, either way they must respect that you are still here.*

If you have lower score than any other player, 

> *You have had some close calls but, you have come out of the situation with the most important things intact. Everyone adores you... well, almost everyone*

Otherwise,

> *You fade into the background, you are clearly not as relevant as you thought. Better luck next season if you are still on the show*

Choose either The After or The Before. Taking turns with the other players, move the card on top of this pile to the other one. As you do, narrate a scene from a montage show how your outcome plays out.

## Guidance

### When you have a plan

Be honest about your plans with the other characters. It can be very tempting to try to setup a twist on your own. Resist that urge, let the other players in on your plans enough that they can help you get there.

### When things go sideways.
Sometimes you may be required to turn a card sideways. I use landscape as the normal orientation and, portrait as sideways. It doesn't matter just pick one and be consistent in your group.

### When that thing happens that changes everything

At some point in the story a thing happens, it changes everything! Or maybe it doesn't... Or maybe its ripples are felt in subtle ways which we are not meant to understand. Sometimes the thing is the same thing for all the characters and sometimes the thing is a different thing.

The point is, there is a thing which we don't name and we don't talk about that separates the story into two parts. The parts that happen before it from the parts that happen after it. We call the before part of our story *The Before* and we represent it with a pile of cards in front of us and to the left. Likewise, We call the after part of our story *The After* and we represent it with a pile of cards in front of us and to the right.

### When you take five

You are going to work on *The Pilot* and you are going to create an awesome setup for a melodrama about a group of time-traveling android archaeologists in some kind of love dodecahedron. Then, the rules are going to tell you to *take 5* and you are going to want to ignore it. DON'T! The breaks are there for a reason. They will give your group time to use the bathroom or grab snacks without interrupting the flow of the game later on. They also gives you some time to turn things over in your own brain or lets you talk about things with another player outside the rules of the game.

### When you can't agree

Flip a coin, go with it.

### When things don't make any sense

This game takes some liberties with the linearity of time. Finalities such as death can lead to some awkward situations. Here are some ways to avoid the confusion which might be caused by reconciling disparate stories.
* Let things not make sense. Shows have plot holes all the time. It's okay!
* Literally and figuratively, use a cliffhanger. Don't chop off someones head when you can kick them over the edge of a cliff and walk away.
* Crazy things happen in the real world. Crazier things happen in an imaginary world. Perhaps some fundamental assumption you made about the world is just wrong. Maybe death isn't so final or maybe you aren't as good at killing as you thought.
